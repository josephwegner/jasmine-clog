It has not been tested in Internet Explorer, but should work in the most recent versions.\r\n\r\nTo run tests yourself, check out the `/tests` folder.\r\n\r\n**Note:** Regardless of browser compatability, jasmine-clog should fail gracefully.  You will see an error thrown in your logs, but the rest of your jasmine tests should run successfully.\r\n\r\n","tagline":"Override default console.log behavior and move it into jasmine","note":"Don't delete this file!
